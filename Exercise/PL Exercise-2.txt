	1. Select from any table a number and determine whether it is within a given range (for example, between 1 and 10).

	Ans: delimiter //
	     create procedure abc()
	begin
	declare x int;
	select id into x from employee where fname='Pratik';
    if(x between 1 and 10) then
		select concat(x, ' is between 1 and 10');
	else
		select concat(x, ' is not between 1 and 10');
	end if;
	end; //
	delimiter ;

	call abc();

	
	2. Select from any table three positive integers representing the sides of a triangle, and determine whether
	   they form a valid triangle. Hint: In a triangle, the sum of any two sides must always be greater than the third side.

	
	Ans: delimiter //
	     create procedure abc()
	begin
	declare x int;
    declare y int;
    declare z int;
    select id into x from employee where fname='Reshma';
    select id into y from employee where fname='Onkar';
    select id into z from employee where fname='Sneha';
    if(x+y>z and y+z>x and x+z>y) then
		select 'Valid Triangle' as type;
	else
		select 'Invalid Triangle' as type;
	end if;
	end; //
	delimiter ;

	call abc();


	2. Select from any table three positive integers representing the sides of a triangle, and determine
	   whether they form a valid triangle. Hint: In a triangle, the sum of any two sides must always be greater than the third side.

	Ans: delimiter //
	     create procedure abc(y int)
	  begin
	if(mod(y,4)=0 and mod(y,100)!=0 or mod(y,400)=0) then
		select 'Leap Year' year_type;
	else
		select 'Not a Leap Year' year_type;
	end if;
	end; //
	delimiter ;

	call abc(2020);


	4. Write a program that Selects from any table two character strings. Your program should then determine if one
	   character string exists inside another character string.

	Ans: delimiter //
	     create procedure abc()
	   begin
	declare sub varchar(20);
    declare var varchar(20);
	select fname into var from employee where id=1;
    select substr(fname,2,2) into sub from employee where id=1;
    if(instr(sub, var)!=0 or instr(var, sub)!=0) then
		select 'It is a substring';
	else
		select 'Not a substring';
	end if;
	end; //
	delimiter ;

	call abc();
